# Hey there, I'm Oleksandr! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub universe – where code meets creativity! I'm a passionate **Web Developer** who loves building sleek, responsive, and interactive web applications. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me exploring new tech trends, sipping my favorite brew, or dreaming up my next project. 🚀

## Programming Languages & Tools 🎨

Here's a playful peek into my tech palette:

```javascript
// My tech stack represented in code:
const techStack = [
  { language: "HTML",    icon: "📄", rating: "💯" },
  { language: "CSS",     icon: "🎨", rating: "💯" },
  { language: "JavaScript", icon: "⚡", rating: "💯" },
  { language: "Python", icon: "🔧", rating: "20%" }
];

techStack.forEach(item => {
  console.log(`I craft magic with ${item.language} ${item.icon} at ${item.rating} proficiency!`);
});
