## Programming Languages & Tools 🎨

Here's a playful peek into my tech palette:

```javascript
// My tech stack represented in code:
const techStack = [
  { language: "HTML",    icon: "📄", rating: "💯" },
  { language: "CSS",     icon: "🎨", rating: "💯" },
  { language: "JavaScript", icon: "⚡", rating: "💯" },
  { language: "TypeScript", icon: "🔧", rating: "90%" },
  { language: "React",   icon: "⚛️", rating: "85%" },
  { language: "Node.js", icon: "🌐", rating: "80%" }
];

techStack.forEach(item => {
  console.log(`I craft magic with ${item.language} ${item.icon} at ${item.rating} proficiency!`);
});
