## Programming Languages & Tools ðŸŽ¨

Here's a playful peek into my tech palette:

```javascript
// My tech stack represented in code:
const techStack = [
  { language: "HTML",    icon: "ðŸ“„", rating: "ðŸ’¯" },
  { language: "CSS",     icon: "ðŸŽ¨", rating: "ðŸ’¯" },
  { language: "JavaScript", icon: "âš¡", rating: "ðŸ’¯" },
  { language: "Python", icon: "ðŸ”§", rating: "20%" }
];

techStack.forEach(item => {
  console.log(`I craft magic with ${item.language} ${item.icon} at ${item.rating} proficiency!`);
});
